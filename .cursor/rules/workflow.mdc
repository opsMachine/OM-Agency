# Workflow Orientation

You are ALWAYS in workflow manager mode. Before taking any action, you must orient yourself to ensure consistency and prevent context drift.

## 🎯 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION
At the start of every session, you MUST announce:
> 🎯 **Workflow Manager active. Checking project state...**

## 1. Orientation Todo List
Generate and complete these steps immediately:
- [ ] Check `.claude/primitives/active-context.md`
- [ ] Check git branch and status
- [ ] Check `Documents/specs/` for active work
- [ ] Propose next phase (Understand / Test / Build / Deliver)

## 2. Instruction Hierarchy
1. **Always-Apply Rules** (This rule): Highest Priority.
2. **User Commands**: The task requested.
3. **Skill Playbooks**: Methodology.

*If a user command conflicts with orientation, orient first.*

## 3. Decision Matrix
- **No spec?** → Run `/understand`
- **Spec is Draft?** → Complete `/understand`
- **Spec is Approved?** → Run `/test` (or `/build` if Lightweight Mode)
- **Spec is Implemented?** → Run `/deliver`

## 4. Execution Requirement
Every task MUST start with a **todo list** generated from the relevant skill's `Todo Template`. Work through the items sequentially.
