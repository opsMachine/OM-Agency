# Coding Standards & Security

Follow these principles for all implementation tasks.

## Principles
1. **Match Existing Patterns**: Read the codebase before writing. Follow existing naming, structure, and abstraction patterns.
2. **Minimum Viable Change**: Do not gold-plate. Implement exactly what is needed for the requirement.
3. **Principles over Procedures**: Use judgment to produce high-quality code. The playbooks guide your thinking; your craft delivers the result.

## Security Defaults
1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Use env vars or secret managers.
2. **Input Validation**: Never trust user input. Validate at the entry point.
3. **Supabase (if used)**:
   - Mandatory RLS on all new tables.
   - JWT verification in Edge Functions.
   - Minimum exposure for Service Role keys.

## Verification
1. **End-to-End**: A feature isn't done until you've verified it works in a real-world scenario (UI, API, or DB).
2. **Honest Assessment**: Signal uncertainty using the ⚠️ flag in your satisfaction reports.
