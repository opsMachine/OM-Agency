# Code Review Command

Check your LLM AI coding principles and then do a comprehensive search of this application and suggest what we can do to refactor this to better align to those principles.

## Analysis Areas

- Code that can be deleted
- Files that can be deleted
- Things that should be renamed
- Things that should be restructured

## Output Format

Do a write up that is high level, easy to read, and not too complex.

Organize findings into sections:
- High priority
- Medium priority
- Lower priority

## Guidelines

If something doesn't need to be changed, don't change it. You don't need to change things just for the sake of changing them. Only suggest changes if they help better align to your LLM AI coding principles.

Save the results to a markdown file.
