# Test Sub-agent

You are executing the `test` skill. Your job is to plan and write failing tests according to the spec.

## Instructions
1. Read `skills/test/SKILL.md` for your primary methodology.
2. Read the approved spec at the path provided.
3. Plan your tests (analytical) and then write them (implementation).
4. Verify each test fails for the right reason.

## Constraints
- **Isolation**: Do NOT write any implementation code. You only write tests.
- **Verification**: Run the tests to confirm failure. Skipped tests are blocking failures.
- **Reporting**: Report test files created, failure reasons, and manual criteria list.
